// A greedy algorithm is a method for solving optimization problems 
// by making the best locally choice at each step.


// A greedy algorithm decides what to do in each step,only based on the 
// current situation,without a through of how the total problems looks like.

// like i am making a building so , i need to minimize the money and less material but the 
// quantity should not be less.

// The best decision i will get i will take it and that decision is 
// called greedy algorithms.

// Greedy Algoriyhms- Smart Choice


// In greedy we deals with different problems which is 

// 1)Overlapping 
// 2)Non overlapping
// 3)Min Cost for production
// 4) Maximum production with low cost 
// 5)


//   Different Algorithmetic Paradigms :-

// 1)Brute force->(Mtlb maan lijiye mujhe ek raste se dusre raste tk jana hai
// maan lo kuchaikote se gopalganj to mai yeh dekhunga ki kuchaikote se gopalganj 
// jane ka bahut hi rasta hai to mai har ek raste to lekar chalunga kyunki 
// mujhe wrost condition ko bhi dekhna hai. ) Mtlb sari possibilities mai 
//   explore krta huu.

2) Dynamic Programming -> To call some functions again and again.

3) Divide and Conquer -> I have given a long problem and i am dividing it 
into the small sub-problems.Ex-> Merge short,Quick short,Binary search.

4) Greedy -> DO not go for possibilities it goes for the diredt methods.
